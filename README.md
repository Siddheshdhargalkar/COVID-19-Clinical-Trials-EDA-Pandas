COVID-19 Clinical Trials EDA using Pandas
Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 clinical trials data sourced from ClinicalTrials.gov. The goal is to analyze the dataset using Python to extract meaningful insights about these trials.

Key Details
Domain: Data Analytics & Data Science
Difficulty: Intermediate
Tools: Python (Pandas), SQL, Excel
About the Dataset
The dataset contains XML files with clinical trials data, each named after its NCT number (study identifier), along with a CSV file providing key details. The data is maintained by NIH and available on Kaggle.

Objectives
Analyze trends in COVID-19 clinical trials, such as:
Geographic distribution
Study status (ongoing/completed)
Phases and participant demographics
Clean and preprocess data
Create visualizations for insights
Methodology
Data Acquisition: Downloaded XML and CSV files.
Data Cleaning: Processed XML files and structured data using Pandas.
EDA: Conducted statistical analysis to identify key metrics.
Visualization: Used Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations.
Reporting: Compiled findings into a structured report.
Tools & Technologies
Python: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
Pandas: Data handling and analysis
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualizations
SQL & Excel: Data querying and exploration
